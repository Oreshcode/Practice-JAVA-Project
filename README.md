The app doesn't have a specific goal in mind, an API was selected at random from free API's. It is a very basic app that allows me to practice API calls and responses. Creating new objects, classes, transfering data from 1 class to another and others. 
Created 4 Panels that the user can use. A Login screen, a Registration Screen, the main Home screen accessible upon Login. Home screen includes a table of Job postings taken from the API's response and can be changed based on user input in the options. Upon selecting a Job, it can then be viewed by pressing a button.

**This is entirely for practice purposes, the only reason I am uploading it here is to be able to track progress and have access to the project from different areas.**

Currently planned additions:
Making more requests to the API in order to fill the dropdown menu with the available API given tags.

Currently users are saved manually in a class, I plan to create a database where with a SQL server request, where multiple checks will be ran to determine whether the user exists or not, whether the Login information is correct or not and in the Registration part, after validations have passed to add the user to the database Array of Users and then to be allowed to log in with that information later on.

Re-arranging Packages and splitting my current Coordinator and DataProvider files into multiple ones and rearranging the code for only the classes they refer to.

Add more buttons for Logout/Navigating Between windows.
